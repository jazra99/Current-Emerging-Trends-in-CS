Overview

In this project, I developed a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning to navigate a maze and find treasure efficiently. The starter code provided the maze environment, reward structure, and portions of the training framework.

I implemented the core components myself, including:

Building the deep Q-network (DQN) model

Implementing the Q-learning training process

Configuring hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate)

Adding experience replay for training stability

Testing, debugging, and tuning the agent to improve performance

Through iterative testing and refinement, I trained the agent to consistently solve the maze using learned policies rather than predefined instructions.

Connection to Computer Science

Computer scientists design algorithms and systems to solve complex problems efficiently and reliably. Their work matters because intelligent systems are used in critical areas such as healthcare, finance, cybersecurity, and automation.

This project demonstrated how theoretical AI concepts—such as reinforcement learning and neural networks—are applied to real-world decision-making problems. It reinforced how machines can learn optimal behavior through interaction and feedback.

My Problem Solving
Throughout this course, I strengthened my approach to solving problems by:

Clearly defining the objective and constraints

Breaking the system into manageable components

Selecting appropriate algorithms

Iteratively testing and debugging

Refining performance through experimentation

Rather than simply writing code, I focused on understanding how the learning process worked and how design choices affected outcomes.

Ethical Responsibilities
As a computer scientist, I am responsible for building systems that are reliable, secure, and ethically designed.

To end users, this means ensuring fairness, transparency, and safety while protecting data and preventing harmful behavior.
To organizations, this means delivering well-tested, maintainable systems and being honest about limitations and risks.

Even though this project involved a simulated agent, it reinforced the importance of responsible AI development in real-world applications.
